# Where you could have travelled

Personal project attempting to curb a user's spending.

With a user's Monzo account, they will be notified where they could have travelled to for the money they just spent.

# Tech

Up to now, I've used a combination of Express and React along with the Monzo and Skyscanner APIs.

# Where I am with it

So far, users are able to interact with the front end and generate their transactions and flights to specific countries. The handling of the Monzo and Skyscanner APIs is by the Express backend. This is to ensure the front end is lightweight as possible and is able to call on these JSON objects.
